                Use a number line from 0 to 20 and beyond. Encourage your child to point and count forwards, then practice counting backwards to understand sequencing.

                Place 20 small objects (like blocks or counters) in a row. Have your child count each item, moving forwards and then backwards to reinforce order.

                Start by counting on fingers to 10, then extend to 20 using both hands or feet, helping them visualize numbers growing and shrinking as they count forwards or backwards.

                Use movement to reinforce counting. For example, take steps forwards and backwards as they count, helping connect numbers with spatial direction.
